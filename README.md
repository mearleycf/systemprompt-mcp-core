# systemprompt-agent-server

A specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with [systemprompt.io](https://systemprompt.io) to provide powerful prompt management capabilities. This server enables
seamless creation, management, and versioning of system prompts through MCP. It works in conjunction with the [multimodal-mcp-client](https://github.com/Ejb503/multimodal-mcp-client) to
provide a complete voice-powered AI workflow solution.

A specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables you to create, manage, and extend AI agents through a powerful prompt and tool management system. This server works as the backend for creating sophisticated AI workflows by managing system prompts, tools, and agent configurations.

An API KEY is required to use this server. You can get one [here](https://systemprompt.io/console).

## Required Client

This server is designed to work with the [multimodal-mcp-client](https://github.com/Ejb503/multimodal-mcp-client) - a voice-powered MCP client that provides the frontend interface. Please make sure to set up both components for the full functionality.

## Why Use This Server?

- **Agent Management**: Create and manage AI agents with customized system prompts and tool configurations
- **Extensible Tool System**: Add, modify, and combine tools to enhance your agents' capabilities through MCP
- **Prompt Management**: Centralized management of system prompts with versioning and metadata support
- **Type-Safe Integration**: Full TypeScript support with proper error handling
- **MCP Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with [multimodal-mcp-client](https://github.com/Ejb503/multimodal-mcp-client) and other MCP-compatible clients
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the MIT license

## Features

### Agent Management

- Create and configure AI agents with specific capabilities
- Manage agent states and contexts
- Define agent behaviors through system prompts
- Monitor and debug agent interactions

### Tools

- Extend agent capabilities with custom tools
- Built-in tools include:

  - `create_prompt` - Create and manage text notes
  - `edit_prompt` - Handle system prompt versionin
  - `create_resource` - Update agent settings
  - `edit_resource` - Update agent settings
  - `list_resources` - Update agent settings
  - `read_resource` - Update agent settings

- Add your own tools through the MCP interface

### Prompts

- Create and version system prompts
- Manage prompt templates
- Access structured prompts for various use cases

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:

```bash
npm run watch
```

## Installation

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "systemprompt-agent-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/systemprompt-agent-server/build/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

## Testing

This project uses Jest for testing with TypeScript and ESM (ECMAScript Modules) support.

### Test Configuration

The test setup includes:

- Full TypeScript support with ESM modules
- Global fetch mocking
- Automatic test reset between runs
- Custom matchers for validation
- Type-safe mocking utilities

#### Module Resolution

The project uses a dual module resolution strategy:

- Source code uses ESM (ECMAScript Modules) with `.js` extensions
- Tests use CommonJS for compatibility with Jest

This is configured through two TypeScript configurations:

- `tsconfig.json`: Main configuration for source code (ESM)
- `tsconfig.test.json`: Test-specific configuration (CommonJS)

```typescript
// Source code imports (ESM)
import { Something } from "../path/to/module.js";

// Test file imports (CommonJS)
import { Something } from "../path/to/module";
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

Tests are located in `__tests__` directories next to the files they test. The naming convention is `*.test.ts`.

### Test Utilities

The project provides a comprehensive set of test utilities in `src/__tests__/test-utils.ts`:

```typescript
// Create test fixtures
const note = TestFixtures.createNote({ title: "Custom Note" });
const noteList = TestFixtures.createNoteList(3); // Creates 3 test notes

// Type-safe partial mocks
const mockService = createPartialMock<SystemPromptService>({
  getNotes: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
});

// Async utilities
await flushPromises(); // Wait for all promises to resolve
```

### Best Practices

1. Always provide proper types for prompt inputs and outputs
2. Include comprehensive metadata for better prompt management
3. Use the built-in validation before creating prompts
4. Follow the systemprompt.io format guidelines
